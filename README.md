git init -u https://github.com/jfdsmabalot/platform_manifest -b Gnome-44

This is an early alpha build. You need to add the kernel repos for other nexus devices since this only contains the kernel and build specific for mako.
Once you have added AOSP kernel repo's for your specific Nexus device, it will build it with n issues.
